**CPSC 362 - Software Engineering Project**  
**FALL 2022**  

**Project Scope:**  

The idea for this project arose when we realized that there is not an easy way to order food online for people with allergies without researching first. Fast food chains come with the convenience of having many locations and online ordering services, therefore, an easy go-to spot. Unless a person looks up the allergen menu of the restaurant first, they are unaware of the risk they may put themselves through by ordering a certain food choice at that location. That is why we decided to create an online food ordering bot, but catering to the majority of Americans who suffer with food allergies by adding the features that follow:    
  
     - A way for customers to identify their allergens  
     - Customer can select a restaurant choice  
     - Customer will ONLY be shown menu options that do NOT contain their allergens specified before  
     - Checkout system
